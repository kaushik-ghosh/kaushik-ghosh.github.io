title: I need to find a new job
layout: post
---
I am thinking about getting a new job everyday for last one year at least, but every time I get a call from job portals I deny it. perhaps, I think the problem is that I know I need a new job but don't know where to apply. I completely not interested to switch job just for money and keeping the job profile same, instead I would prefer a more challenging role. But another question arises, why new firm give me a challenging role?. I guess even before this, I should rather ask whether my current firm does offer me a challenging role??
How do you define challenging?
Challenging means a job, for doing which you might feel curious & interesting, and at the same time are tough and difficult to complete. Most of the people or you can say majority of the people looks for challenging role thinking that challenging role is difficult and tough and success is only achieved by doing a tough job. 
With my current responsibilities in the firm, I am facing a huge dilemma where I should apply next. I have listed down few things where I am planning to get into:

	1. New Module - This is the most easiest of the task and not in the terms of working but choosing among choices. I have already thought which module I should learn and even I have already tried and utilized an opportunity in my last project to show cast my interest in the module. My involvement and gist to learn new things was appreciated by my manager. 
	2. Learn a new entirely new skill - Learning a entirely new skill is challenging as you never know whether you like it or not and most important thing whether the firm has good projects for it. Otherwise it will be just a waste of time with all learning and no use.
	3. Learn Programming - I better discuss with my brother on this.. I guess he is the nearest possible solution to this.
