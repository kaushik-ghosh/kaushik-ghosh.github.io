title: I need a new Job

I guess i am thinking about getting a new job everyday for last one year at least, but every time I get a call from job portals I deny it. perhaps, I think the problem is that I know I need a new job but don't know where to apply. I completely not interested to switch job just for money and keeping the job profile same, instead I would prefer a more challenging role. But another question arises, why new firm give me a challenging role?. I guess even before this, I should rather ask whether my current firm does offer me a challenging role??
