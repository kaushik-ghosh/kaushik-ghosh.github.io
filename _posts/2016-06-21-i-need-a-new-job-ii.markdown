With my current responsibilities in the firm, I am facing a huge dilemma where I should apply next. I have listed down few things where I am planning to get into:

New Module - This is the most easiest of the task and not in the terms of working but choosing among choices. I have already thought which module i should learn and even i have already tried and utilized an opportunity in my last project to show cast my interest in the module and my involvement and gist to learn new things was appreciated by my manager.

Learn a new entirely new skill - Learning a entirely new skill is challenging as you never know whether you like it or not and most important thing whether the firm has good projects for it. Otherwise it will be just a waste of time with all learning and no use.

Learn Programming - I better discuss with my brother on this.. i guess he is the nearest possible solution to this.
