title: Things I worry about - 1
layout: post

There are endless things which I do worry about ranging from trivial to important, small to big etc.. I'll list down few things here for start.
1. Completing job - I worry too much about the job which is given to me or lets say a problem, instead of discussing with friends and senior I try to find the workaround of a problem on my own thinking that in today's technological world everything is found in internet and one does only needs to look at the right place but most of the time you get this wrong. This situation occurs in projects. In project, every individual have set of task he/she needs to perform to complete the project but there are many things apart from the individual tasks that are important and needs to be completed in time and that varies as per project and its location. 
Now when we work in team, we need to collaborate, cooperate and pragmatic. Now in project, individuals are assigned certain tasks that manager thinks he/she can deliver. Now when I am enlisted with certain tasks, my first preference is always remain to complete the tasks on my own rather than decide and discuss with colleagues how the tasks would be completed and seek out to someone who had previously done this type of job. Now doing things alone most of the times become time consuming which affect your productivity and unproductiveness and ineffectiveness in completing a task in time leads to pile of incomplete job list and in time being becomes a burden to face. 
We need to prioritize, seek out and ask individuals in order reduce the burden and improve your productivity because ultimately delivering the project in time is more important than your individual learning. 

Will continue more on next blog.
